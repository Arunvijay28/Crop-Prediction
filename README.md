# Crop-Prediction
It a web based application for crop prediction based on Aritifical Intelligence algorithm called Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) within it ,our code is done with intelligent backtracking strategy
In which :
Variables: A list containt crops,
Domains: A set of 10 crops,
Constraints: Temperature,Precipitation,Humidity etc..,
Dataset: It has  data taken from government and synthetic data so it has an accuracy of 89% by providing proper dataset it can able to provide crops with an accuracy of 99.5%,
Intelligent Backtracking:
It get the constraints from the user and based on it finds the specific crops that satisfy that particular constraint and it will be added in the variables once if a contraint is not satisified it add the previous crop in the variables and does the intelligent backtracking and begins with new crop
